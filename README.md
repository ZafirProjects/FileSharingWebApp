This project was made for my second year of university group project.
It uses a Java Spring Boot backend and a React frontend.
The files and MySQL database were stored on an Azure cloud which is no longer active.
The web app allows students to do the following:
- Upload files
- Download files
- Register
- Login
- Communicate on a live Forum
- JWTs for authentication and authorization
- Cookies to track state

The front end needs to be run using an npm command
The backend end needs to be run using Maven or IntelliJ

Due to the cloud server not running anymore, this project no longer works. However, the effort, methodology, and technology can be seen.
